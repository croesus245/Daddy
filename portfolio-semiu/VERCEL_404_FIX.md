## Common Fixes

### Fix 1: Clear CDN Cache
- Vercel caches deployments
- The old 404 page might be cached
- Hard refresh usually fixes this
- Ctrl + Shift + Delete ‚Üí Clear Cache

### Fix 2: Redeploy via Vercel Dashboard
- Sometimes git push doesn't trigger build
- Manual redeploy ensures build happens
- Takes 2-3 minutes

### Fix 3: Empty Commit to Force Deploy
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: force redeploy"
git push origin main
```

### Fix 4: Check Environment Variables
- SMTP settings might be missing
- Email functionality might fail
- But shouldn't cause 404

---

## Next Actions

1. **Immediately**: Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **If still 404**: Manual redeploy from Vercel dashboard
3. **If still fails**: Empty commit and push to trigger new build
4. **If persists**: Check Vercel build logs for errors
